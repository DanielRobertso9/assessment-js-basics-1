// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "This step is where you will Define what the software is meant to do, along with features and what resources you will need to achieve the end product"
const design = "This step you will be Designing steps that will layout how the application will operate and look, steps such as architecture, programming, ui, security"
const implementation = "This step is where the program will be written and start to take shape"
const testing = "This step is where the application will go thru QA and the application and each function will be tested"
const maintain = "Once the application has be deployed, this step will correct any bugs that have been discovered while being used by the users"
